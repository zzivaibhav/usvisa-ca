# US Visa Rescheduler for Canada


Surprisingly, this project has proven to be more useful than initially thought. I will try to maintain it as long as possible, given my availability and access to test accounts.

A simple Python script for making US visa interview appointments in Canada

## Setup

Make sure you have booked an appointment on https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-ca/.

Install dependencies (Python3 is required):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Modify `settings.py` as per the instructions within the script:

```python3
USER_EMAIL = "name@gmail.com"
USER_PASSWORD = "yourpassword"
EARLIEST_ACCEPTABLE_DATE = "2024-01-01"  # this is now only used in detecting
LATEST_ACCEPTABLE_DATE = "2024-03-14" 
```

### Find a slot and book it automatically

```sh
python reschedule.py
```

or:

### Only find slots and send you an email when a slot is found 

Setup additional constants:
```python3
#Gmail login info
GMAIL_SENDER_NAME = ""
GMAIL_EMAIL = ""
GMAIL_APPLICATION_PWD = ""

#Receiver info
RECEIVER_NAME = ""
RECEIVER_EMAIL = ""
```

and run the script:

```sh
python detect_and_notify.py
```

See the script in action. Once you're satisfied with its functionality, set `TEST_MODE` to `False` in `settings.py`. For a headless operation, you can also set `SHOW_GUI` to `False` and allow the script to run unattended.

## Caution

It may not always be feasible to reschedule an appointment multiple times. Therefore, it's crucial to use `TEST_MODE = True` for testing purposes and ensure the `LATEST_ACCEPTABLE_DATE` is genuinely acceptable to you.

## Contribution

Please feel free to report issues. PRs are welcomed and greatly appreciated!

The script can be flaky especially for the `legacy_rescheduler`.  Plans are in place to rewrite it using `requests`, but a test account is needed.

I have received some reports on potential problems in `legacy_rescheduler`. I need test accounts to understand the problems, if you would like to help please send me an email via the website in my bio.
